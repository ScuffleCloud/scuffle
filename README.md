## Welcome to Scuffle!

Scuffle is an opensource live streaming platform.

This project is very much a WIP and has no functional component right now!

For more information on what this is going to be, check out [our conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvQpMRkzoVM&t=593s)

You can also look at our [design documents](./design/README.md).
